# Introduction to NFTs

If you're interested in digital art, collectibles, or blockchain technology, you may have heard of NFTs. But what are they, and why are they generating so much buzz? In this article, we'll explore the basics of NFTs and why they're causing such a stir in the art world.

## What is an NFT?

An NFT, or non-fungible token, is a unique digital asset that is stored on a blockchain. Unlike cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, which are fungible (meaning that each unit is interchangeable with another unit), NFTs are unique and cannot be exchanged on a one-to-one basis.

## How do NFTs work?

NFTs are created using smart contracts on a blockchain, typically the Ethereum blockchain. When an artist creates an NFT, they are essentially creating a digital certificate of ownership for a specific digital asset, such as an image, video, or piece of music.

## Why are NFTs so popular?

NFTs have gained popularity in recent years because they allow for the creation and sale of unique digital assets, which was previously difficult or impossible to do. Additionally, because NFTs are stored on a blockchain, they provide a secure and transparent way to prove ownership of a digital asset.
